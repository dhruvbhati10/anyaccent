# Privacy Policy for AnyAccent

*Last Updated: January 31, 2026*

**AnyAccent** ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our application handles your data.

## 1. No Data Collection
AnyAccent is an offline-first application. We do not collect, store, transmit, or sell any of your personal data, usage statistics, or audio recordings to external servers.

* We do not require you to create an account.
* We do not use third-party analytics (like Google Analytics or Mixpanel).
* We do not use tracking cookies or advertising identifiers.

## 2. Microphone & Audio Data
To provide pronunciation feedback, AnyAccent requires access to your device's microphone.

* **How it works:** When you record your voice during a drill, the audio is processed locally on your device using Apple's Speech framework and internal algorithms.
* **No Uploads:** Your voice recordings are never uploaded to our servers or any third-party cloud. They are processed in real-time RAM and immediately discarded after the analysis score is generated.

## 3. Speech Recognition
The app uses Apple’s native `SFSpeechRecognizer` to analyze your speech accuracy. We explicitly request on-device speech recognition to ensure offline functionality and privacy.

Data sent to Apple's speech engine follows strictly local processing protocols where supported by your device settings.

## 4. Local Data Storage
Your app progress, streak data, settings, and unlocked chapters are stored locally on your device using `UserDefaults` and local file storage.

* If you delete the app, this data will be lost unless you have enabled iCloud device backups (which are managed by Apple, not us).
